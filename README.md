# Crowdfunding_ETL

For this mini-project, I created an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform the data provided on crowdfunding campaigns. I created 4 CSV files (Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts) to create an ERD schema. The CSV's were then loaded into a Postgres database to display the data.
