# Crowdfunding_ETL

I worked on this project individually using the class resources, Slack channel, and attending office hours.
I created 4 dataframes from the two spreadsheets that were provided, crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx using Pandas. I was able to modify the spreadsheets in Excel using the Text to Columns function before importing them. The dataframes were exported as csv files.
I used QuickDBD to create the ERD of the 4 dataframes, category, subcategory, campaign, and contacts, to show the inter-relationships between the tables from the csv files. 
Then I created the crowdfunding_db in Postgres using SQL. I imported the csv files and displayed the data by selecting the columns.
